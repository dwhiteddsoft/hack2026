### UI Design Principles

Since this is a library rather than a user-facing application, the "UI" consists of the API design:

#### API Design Principles
1. **Simplicity:** One-line inference for common use cases
2. **Flexibility:** Detailed configuration options for advanced users
3. **Type Safety:** Leverage Rust's type system to prevent runtime errors
4. **Performance:** Zero-cost abstractions where possible
5. **Discoverability:** Clear method names and comprehensive documentation

#### Example API Usage
```rust
// Simple usage
let session = UniversalSession::from_model_file("yolov8n.onnx")?;
let detections = session.infer_image("test_image.jpg").await?;

// Advanced usage
let session = UniversalSession::builder()
    .model_file("custom_model.onnx")
    .config_file("model_config.yaml")
    .provider(ExecutionProvider::CUDA)
    .batch_size(4)
    .build()?;

let results = session.infer_batch(&images).await?;
```
