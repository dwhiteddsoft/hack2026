## How to Use

### 1. Defining a New Feature
1. Use the Interactive Feature Definition Assistant (`.claude/commands/feature_definition.md`)
2. The assistant will guide you through a structured conversation
3. Feature definition will be created in `features/[feature-name].md`
4. User stories will be created in `user-stories/[feature-name]/`

### 2. Documentation Standards
- Use the templates in the `templates/` folder for consistency
- Follow the naming convention: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `user-authentication.md`)
- Keep feature definitions focused and comprehensive
- Break down user stories into implementable chunks

### 3. Maintenance
- Update feature definitions as requirements evolve
- Archive completed features by adding a "Status: Completed" section
- Link related features and dependencies clearly

## Feature Status Tracking

| Feature Name | Status | Priority | Last Updated | Owner |
|-------------|--------|----------|--------------|-------|
| *No features defined yet* | - | - | - | - |

*This table will be updated as features are added to the documentation.*

## Guidelines

### Feature Naming
- Use descriptive, action-oriented names
- Keep names concise but clear
- Example: `user-authentication`, `payment-processing`, `admin-dashboard`

### Documentation Quality
- Include all phases from the feature definition process
- Provide clear acceptance criteria for each user story
- Document assumptions and constraints
- Include technical specifications and dependencies

### Review Process
1. Initial feature definition through the assistant
2. Technical review with development team
3. Stakeholder approval
4. Regular updates as implementation progresses
