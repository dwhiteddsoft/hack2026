# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get started with the feature definition process using the Interactive Feature Definition Assistant.

## Step 1: Prepare for Feature Definition

Before starting, gather:
- [ ] Initial feature concept or request
- [ ] Stakeholder information (who requested it)
- [ ] Business context (why now, what goal)
- [ ] Any existing documentation or requirements

## Step 2: Run the Feature Definition Assistant

1. Open Claude and reference the feature definition command:
   ```
   /feature_definition
   ```

2. The assistant will guide you through 5 phases:
   - **Phase 1:** Feature Overview & Context
   - **Phase 2:** Functional Requirements Deep Dive  
   - **Phase 3:** Technical Specifications
   - **Phase 4:** User Story Development
   - **Phase 5:** Documentation & Next Steps

## Step 3: Document Your Feature

The assistant will automatically create:
- `docs/features/[your-feature-name].md` - Complete feature definition
- `docs/user-stories/[your-feature-name]/` - Individual user story files

## Step 4: Review and Refine

1. **Technical Review:** Share with development team for technical feasibility
2. **Stakeholder Review:** Get approval from business stakeholders  
3. **Estimation:** Work with team to estimate effort and complexity
4. **Prioritization:** Add to product backlog with appropriate priority

## Tips for Success

### During Feature Definition
- **Be specific:** Vague requirements lead to scope creep
- **Think end-to-end:** Consider the complete user journey
- **Ask "why":** Understand the underlying need, not just the requested solution
- **Consider edge cases:** What could go wrong?

### After Feature Definition
- **Keep it updated:** Requirements evolve, keep documentation current
- **Link dependencies:** Connect related features and stories
- **Track progress:** Update status as development progresses

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ **Skipping user research:** Don't assume you know what users need
- ❌ **Over-engineering:** Start simple, add complexity later
- ❌ **Ignoring technical constraints:** Involve developers early
- ❌ **Missing acceptance criteria:** Without clear criteria, "done" is subjective
- ❌ **Forgetting about data:** Consider where data comes from and goes
